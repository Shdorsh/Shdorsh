- 👋 Hi, I’m @Shdorsh
- 👀 I’m interested in frontend and backend development, 
- 🌱 I’m currently at the end of a webdesign bootcamp.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that wakes my interest: Webdev projects, anything with Node.js and Dream maker projects like SS13.
- 📫 How to reach me: Uh... do you know a twitch streamer named FailureGuaranteed? He's a pretty great guy, I heard.
